# Classical-Deeplearning-Algorithm
Various Classical Deep-learning Algorithm coded by Tensorflow and Pytorch framework, respectively.

This project include:
1. Linear Regression(coded by numpy and pytorch, respectively)
2. Softmax Regression(coded by Pytorch)
3. LeNet (using mnist dataset, coded by tensorflow)
4. AlexNet (using cifar-10 dataset, coded by tensorflow)
5. ResNet (using cifar-10 dataset, coded by tensorflow)
6. Self-defined dataset in tensorflow input pipline (binary classification)
7. Funetuing_tf funetuing training use vgg16 pretrained net-work (coded by tensorflow)
8. ...
